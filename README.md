### Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Oh hey, look... What is this? It's my nice about me page? But... Hey, you probably don't even know who I am. My name is **Felix**. I'm a self-tought developer mostly developing in python, java and typescript. Normally I'm working on my own (relatively) big projects like my Minecraft Plugin or my website and besides that I try to create some new smaller projects (as you may see in my activities).
